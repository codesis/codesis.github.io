## At last! 
The final blogpost where I answer the final two **exam 1** questions. 

#### **Open Graph**
\- ***What is Open Graph and how do I make use of it?***

Open Graph is a protocol which makes a site easy to share with the same functionality as other objects. For an instance, when different websites are shared of Facebook they are all "treated" the same way, having the same functionality. That is thanks to Open Graph.

Four properties are required for the Open Graph, these are Title, Url, Image and Type. Beside those there are more properties one can, or should depending on what kind of type we have, add to the meta tag. These meta tags are added to the head of our webpage. My *head* are in the folder _includes.

#### **Static Site Generators**
\- ***What do I think about Static Site Generators and what kind of projects are they suitable for?***

I think Satic Site Generators are easy to work with and play around with but at the same time I think it can feel a bit like "all over the place" and not really having 100% control. So maybe it's the best choice if the project leans to smaller sizes than being bigger. 

I like SSG because it's great for a beginner like me to get a grip on what it is like to work with these kind of things. I learn a lot and it is not overwhelming for me.
