# Individual Project

## During the second semester on my web programmer program at the university, we had an individual project course.
## Here I chose to work with MERN, MongoDB ExpressJS ReactJS NodeJS, to create a website.
## My goal for the website was to develop vegan recipes containing nutrition values, as it did not exist such at the time being.
## During this course SCRUM was implemented.

### You can find the project published on heroku here: https://kindfood-se.herokuapp.com/
