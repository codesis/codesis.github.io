*Hello!*

Today has been a day well spent. Well, at least if you consider spending hours of the day on being productive. I've recently been down with the flu, but am now feeling better and has been able to complete school projects I've gone behind with. 

I still have to fix this webpage though, but if you can read this post, I've at least started! *sigh*. Anyway, have to keep fixing it - can't get too far off as the time keeps on moving forward!

Take care,
