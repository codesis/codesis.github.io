Hi!
<img src="https://github.com/codesis/codesis.github.io/blob/master/selfie.jpg?raw=true" alt="selfie" width="150"/>


My name is Emma Källström and I'm a 26 year old living in Kalmar, Sweden.

In August 2018 I began studying at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, taking courses in computer science and media technology.
I've read courses in languages such as JavaScript, PHP and C#. Feeling confident with JS, NodeJS, PHP, Git, HTML, CSS. 
Getting more and more confident with React and GatsbyJS as I am currently coding with it. Would like to get more confident with C#.

Worked frontend, backend as well as fullstack. Enjoying all kinds.
