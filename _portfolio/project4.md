During the course 1dv022 (clientbased webprogramming) we had 3 different examinations. This is the second one. The assignment was to implement a simple quiz. We were given the first question's url, to which we would send the answer. If the player answered correctly, the response would be the next question's url. A small and simple API-assignment you might say, as we POST the answer and GET the next url. However the main focus was on the DOM as you may see in the code [here](https://github.com/codesis/1dv022-exam-2).
