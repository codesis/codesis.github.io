During my study at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, I had the class 1DV607 - "Objektorienterad analys och design med UML" (Object oriented analysis and design with UML). 
For this assignment you were supposed to design and code a game of Yahtzee, playable from the terminal. This was a heavy assignment and I was not able to finish all possible 
possibilites for the game. However it is fully functional and you may find the code here at my GitHub: [Yahtzee](https://github.com/codesis/yahtzee_1dv607)
