During the course 1dv022 (clientbased webprogramming) we had 3 different examinations. This is the third one. This examination's focus is on building a single page application with chat integration against a web socket server. The backend (server-side code) of this assignment will be given and our job is to write the client-side code. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/codesis/1dv022-exam3).
