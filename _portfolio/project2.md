For the course 1DV610, the assignment was to implement a simple CRUD application with focus on testing. Here we used Test Cases and basically TDD to drive us
further to completion with the assignment. You may find the code here: [CRUD - PHP Code](https://github.com/codesis/1dv610_L2) and you may also see the (very) basic CRUD app
here, deployed on Heroku servers: [Live Demo](https://codesis1dv610.herokuapp.com/) . I may warn you, there were NO focus on design with this assignment ðŸ˜‰
