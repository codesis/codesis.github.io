During the course 1dv023 (serverbased webprogramming) we had 3 different examinations. This is the second one. In this assignment, your goal was to create a web application for persistent handling of programming code snippets using an application framework and an object data modeling library for MongoDB. The code is available [here](https://github.com/codesis/1dv023-exam2).
