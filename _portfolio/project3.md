This individual project was made with MERN (=MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). Currently you can view my demo [here](https://youtu.be/W0YHee0P4wk) on YouTube. The application was made specificially for the swedish audience in mind, which is why it's in swedish. My vision was to have a beautiful user experience and to make it on my own without e.g. bootstrap, but my vision was too great and time ran out with the project. So I am not as satisfied with the design and all the functions as I wanted to be (wanted the user to be able to upload an image of the end product of the recipe for example), and some days when I have spare time I try to work on the project again.
