This project is not finished but you may follow the progress [here](https://gatsbychristmaswebsite46619.gtsb.io/) on Gatsby Cloud. The goal for this web application is to see a slim and simple webpage dedicated to christmas. Possibility to hear christmas music (through spotify) and view a gallery with christmas images from all around the world. The project will be remounted on Gatsby Cloud for every commit I make to GitHub. [Here](https://github.com/codesis/gatsby-website) you can view the code on my GitHub.
